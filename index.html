        <h1>Ajay Kumar Mashapari</h1>
        <p>I'm from Hyderabad, India, where I've had the chance to work on a variety of projects that have shaped my skills and professional growth.</p>
        <div class="job-exp">
            <h2>I've gained 3 years of hands-on experience in full-stack development, working on a range of projects using different web technologies and frameworks.</h2>
            <h4>Cognizant Technology Solutions, Hyderabad (01/2020 - 07 /2023)</h4>
            <p>I've worked on exciting projects like building a customer portal using Vue.js, integrated with Adobe Experience Manager for seamless content management.
            I also enjoyed transforming InVision designs into user-friendly product manuals for a leading sewing company, using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and making sure everything worked smoothly with EPiServer.  
            Before this role, I was a Programmer Analyst Trainee, where I received solid training in HTML5, JavaScript (ES6), CSS3, and Firebase. I had the chance to develop proof of concepts and get hands-on experience 
            with various content management systems like AEM, EPiServer, and Drupal. My journey began as an intern at Cognizant, where I completed a full-stack project with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .NET Framework, and MySQL.
            I also developed an e-commerce website using Bootstrap and MVC architecture in Java, and collaborated with a team to create a blog web application. Each of these experiences has fueled my passion for full-stack 
            development and helped shape who I am as a developer today.
